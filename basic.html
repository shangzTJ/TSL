				<h1>Basic functionalities</h1>
                <p>Below you can learn about the most common operations available and how they can be performed.</p>
                <br>

                <h2>Opening window</h2>
                <p>Once the main.py file has been started, the following window will show.</p>
				<img alt="Opening window appearence" src="resources/screenshots/opening.png" width="80%"/>
                <p>The stage is subdivided in two sections: the first is supposed to be adopted if one wants to work with a single file (or multiple
                    heterogeneous files, i.e. files containing time series which are not related to each other), the last if one is interested in
                    creating a project including a list of files in the same folder focused on the same type of time series.</p>
                <blockquote><p>For instance, we could have one huge file containing the data acquired by some sensors in a vehicle (e.g. accelerometers) and
                    another regarding the temperature of a certain environment (e.g. fridge): the data included in these files are not related, so
                    the application doesn't consider them as well and treats each one independently. Instead, if one of these two files is splitted in
                    multiple smaller files, these could be grouped in a folder and included in a project: they will share the same kind of labels and
                    appearence, so there would be no need to manage each one singularly. This of course couldn't be done with heterogeneous contents.</p></blockquote>
                
                <p>In particular, three options are presented through the interface:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Open files</b>: the user can choose which files have to be opened.</li>
                    <ul><li>Each file will have its own configuration file associated, containing all the relevant information regarding labels, layout, etc.</li></ul>

                    <li><b>New project</b>: the application will ask the user which folder has to be used for the project.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The files in the selected directory will be scanned, and if some compatible ones are found they are added in a list</li>
                        <li>A wizard for the setup of the project will open, asking which files have to be included and which labels have to be shared among them.</li>
                        <li>A single configuration file is generated, containing the list of included files, the labels and the layouts (grouped according to the files content).</li>
                    </ul>

                    <li><b>Open project</b>: the program asks for the just mentioned configuration file.</li>
                </ul>
                <blockquote>Please check which type of files are supported in the related documentation page.</blockquote>
